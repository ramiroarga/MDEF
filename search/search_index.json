Since university, I\u2019ve been designing products and services that sought to solve various problems. At IUAV Venice, I learned some physical computing, using arduino to design in the field of social robotics. I worked as an Innovation Advisor/Project coordinator at the Innovation Laboratory of the Municipality of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina (CorLab). I was focused in coordinating social innovation and digital divide projects. From design, I experimented new ways to generate public value, enhance the relationship with citizens, and provide new channels and collaboration from agile work methodologies. I consider myself a proactive person, with good learning and leadership skills. Also, I have very good predisposition for teamwork and I\u2019m used to interdisciplinary work, discovering new opportunities and innovative solutions with team colleagues. I believe collaborative work and systemic thinking are essential paths for solving big worldwide problems.

In this case, it had to adapt to a certain structure and hold a high voltage wire and should have an opening system to remove and insert cables quickly and adjust them efficiently. The prototype was made in 3d printing and was used to achieve these specifications, including the development of the electrical test to measure that no arcing is generated. https://www.behance.net/gallery/83116577/Aislador-para-Cableados-de-Alta-Tension TIP: Robot social para personas mayores (Therapy for isolated people): The present project deals with the design of a Social Robot dedicated to the assistance and active insertion in society of elderly people. Through the use of an intelligent device, the elderly person is stimulated to rediscover activities that do not confine them within the walls of their home. With the purpose of converging in the same place with other users who share similar interests and are in the same situation. Achieving socialization among them, providing a new motivation to leave home. https://www.behance.net/gallery/96238617/TIP-ROBOT-SOCIAL Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry \u201cCiudad Digital:\u201d Is a program that seeks to promote and disseminate different spaces of cultural interest in the city by implementing new technologies, promoting innovation through a process of Digital Transformation. It functioned as a means to disseminate the city\u2019s cultural spaces to the community and to inquiry the incidence and acceptance of digital technology in society through augmented reality. https://www.behance.net/gallery/136512101/Ciudad-Digital Role 3: The prototype as a Research Archetype Premium Electric City Car Concept Exterior and Interior Design. A graphic product of a concept research in the field of automotive transportation looking to a short-term future. https://www.behance.net/gallery/104500733/LAMBORGHINI-SPLENDOR-E https://www.behance.net/gallery/110377549/LAMBORGHINI-SPLENDOR-E Role 4: The prototype as a Vehicle for inquiry LUDIK: Social Innovation Design Project in Food education for children living under vulnerable socio-economic conditions. In this prototyping case, it was a large process where documentation and continuous analysis was made. The prototype was a reflection of the research and represents the result of the whole process, not taking major importance the final tangible prototype. Also, LUDIK was a program created to investigate and create a database of children under these situations, and a means of generating information for future social interventions. https://www.behance.net/gallery/136349695/Innovacion-social-%28Educacion-Alimentaria%29 Although I have had experiences prototyping in the different roles, I think I would like to intervene deeper into role 2 \u201cThe prototype as a means of inquiry\u201d. But I believe that several roles are needed to intersect and be together for a better understanding and development of the design process you carry on. I would like to experiment in intersecting roles 1 and 2, in order to achieve the development of a prototype as an instrument of inquiry but from an experimental experience.

All my design space is based on my struggle and my interests, told through my experiences. Throughout the space I try to capture my concerns along with experiences of projects, programs and products in which I have participated in my life\u2026 (or at least the ones that marked me the most). From collaborative innovation, I can detect food as the main focus of interest, deploying in it issues such as food security and sovereignty, food education and water literacy and its uses. Awareness brings together all the edges of this sector, where environmental sensitivity, nature and circular production and consumption models (circular economy) are also linked. Another area of interest is design for social innovation, its link with advanced technology, robotics and above all the creation of products and services from conscious technology. Technology that addresses social and economic vulnerabilities, which aims to reduce the digital divide. Within this area, I show projects in which I have participated as coordinator and designer, participating with real users who are affected daily by these problems, in some achieving concepts and prototypes and in others achieving impact solutions in the public sector. I chose to accompany this card that I found valuable: Economies of care. I also highlighted the long-termism card as important, because it seems to me a key issue to consider in order to continue on this path as a change-maker for emerging futures. In it I emphasize programs based on multi-scale objectives and accompany it with the card of self-sufficiency, as an important element to achieve long-term solutions. Finally, another area of interest is the mobility of people, understanding this as the means of transportation used and how they seriously impact the planet. That is why I chose the card of: Conscious Mobility, which in turn is related to technology and society.
