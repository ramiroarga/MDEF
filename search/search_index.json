My journey started last year where I experienced a social innovation process that changed my perspective of things. This was a food education project for children living in vulnerable socio-economic situations, to have access to tools for sustainable food production and connection with nature through playing resources. This experience took me through a collaborative design process where I learned what real teamwork means. In its transition, a team of around 40 people was generated, who contributed their expertise to the project to achieve a tangible and creative solution. So I began to expand my knowledge and broaden my interest in collaborative innovation, that is what my poster represents. Books as the \u201cWeb of life\u201d (Fritjof Capra), \u201cMutual Aid-the other law of the jungle\u201d (Servigne and Chapelle), \u201cHow War, Pornography, and Fast Food Have Shaped Modern Technology\u201d (Peter Nowak) and \u201c The city of tomorrow ..\u201d (Ratti and Claudel) have made me understand my role as designers and change-maker in the real world and how nature is the reference to achieve in a collective way to move forward as living beings that inhabit this planet. Although every process requires facing fears, new challenges and changing habits, I\u2019m enjoying my journey by growing as a human being as part of nature and I trust my process. I am a very curious person and eager to learn about everything, that is why I don\u2019t feel able to determine a specific path to follow, as my fields of interest are several. I feel that I have incorporated the \u201chow\u201d and it has to do with the tools I have been talking about. As this extract from Dunne and Raby mentions: \u201cTo achieve change it is necessary to unlock people\u2019s imaginations and apply it to all areas of life at a microscale. Our work is meaningless unless it ignites imaginations and provokes debate: design by mutation is intrinsically collective. Designers produce mutations, some of which will grow, evolve, and develop into tangible artefacts that cause global change \u2013 driven to realization by the energy of the crowd\u201d. My challenge is to find how to unlock people\u2019s imagination, generating those mutations within my fields of interest. I have a potential interest in connecting changemakers in order to achieve bigger impacts towards the construction of resilient places. I believe collective work is the most important thing in order to achieve real and big impact solutions. This trimester I was experimenting in the fields of interest where I want to intervene. I explored the food waste system, technologic and material waste and the transport means of them by a specific community over Barcelona and finally group my interests as \u201chuman habits and conveniences\u201d by understanding the way we consume and generate waste. Then I understood that these habits are responses of our actual mental situation and life, so I started exploring human behavior and how to enhance transformation to a regenerative life, connecting more with nature and personal well-being. I feel that I am moving forward on my path, I intend to explore other of my interests and to continue learning about each intervention I do; understanding what is valuable for me and want to transform.

In this case, it had to adapt to a certain structure and hold a high voltage wire and should have an opening system to remove and insert cables quickly and adjust them efficiently. The prototype was made in 3d printing and was used to achieve these specifications, including the development of the electrical test to measure that no arcing is generated. https://www.behance.net/gallery/83116577/Aislador-para-Cableados-de-Alta-Tension TIP: Robot social para personas mayores (Therapy for isolated people): The present project deals with the design of a Social Robot dedicated to the assistance and active insertion in society of elderly people.

In this prototyping case, it was a large process where documentation and continuous analysis was made. The prototype was a reflection of the research and represents the result of the whole process, not taking major importance the final tangible prototype. Also, LUDIK was a program created to investigate and create a database of children under these situations, and a means of generating information for future social interventions. https://www.behance.net/gallery/136349695/Innovacion-social-%28Educacion-Alimentaria%29 Although I have had experiences prototyping in the different roles, I think I would like to intervene deeper into role 2 \u201cThe prototype as a means of inquiry\u201d. But I believe that several roles are needed to intersect and be together for a better understanding and development of the design process you carry on. I would like to experiment in intersecting roles 1 and 2, in order to achieve the development of a prototype as an instrument of inquiry but from an experimental experience. Research through Design Toolbox Research through Design Toolbox MAP Design Interventions \u00b6 FIRST INTERVENTIONS My focus of interest starts from the understanding of the habits and convenience that we have as human beings, in terms of consumption, participation in the system and relation with nature. As I have been working the last years with food education, my first approach was to try to understand more deeply the food system and our impact. I got to know Nest City Lab, an urban lab for sustainability that experiment with everything that can lead us towards a more meaningful life. It is not only a working space, but a community of practice that cares about the planet and all beings. I started connecting with them and participated in some workshops. One of them caught my interest, it was about zero waste food, so I started learning more about it and I started to put it into practice in my daily life. Then my first intervention came, together with some colleagues that were also interested in the food system and waste. We decided to collect our food and plastic waste from almost a week and then meet for dinner and cook collectively from all our wastes. Reflection from Food Waste Dinner Before: What are my expectations about cooking with food waste? -I really don\u2019t have many good expectations, we will be able to cook something but i don\u2019t think the taste will be really nice. Many waste we take will be thrown away and not transformed into food. However, the experience will be amazing and we will have a good time together cooking and having fun! Why do I think of this as food waste? / why would I normally be throwing it away? -I brought potato and sweet potato peels that i didnt eat when cooking smashed potatoes, and some old olives with its water that nobody wanted to eat in my house. Also some old vegetables that looked bad and were old that I was going to throw away. After: How was the experience? What surprised you? -The experience was really good! I had a lot of fun, we had 3 hours of full collaboration in all the food we cooked, each one had a recipe that we wanted and was able to make with the waste we had. After cooking we shared a nice moment eating all our creations and communicating our feelings and reactions to each thing we tried. All the recipes had an attractive appearance and the taste accompanied it. We finally threw away the waste of our \u201cfood waste\u201d, the result of this was only a bag from almost 5 bags we had initially. This moment of my journey was very important to understand my lifestyle in relation to waste, my food awareness and so I started to explore my lifestyle habits. I began to explore myself, get to know myself and open my knowledge through experiences, books and other resources. This was the point where I began to understand this educational process as something more than a professional path of multiple learning. I understood that I was changing as a person, it gave me the opportunity to be aware of who I am and who I want to be in the future. So I began to feel that it is not a parallel journey to my life, but that they are unified. What is needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior? I started to explore other paths related to human habits and convenience, so I began to connect with Antonio who was also interested in this and wanted to understand his thoughts and perspective. So we started to understand the context around us, interests and tools to start thinking about a big change. Both sides were connected with the purpose, Antonio\u00b4s side from mental health and the central nervous system as the focus of human behaviors and me from nature connection, food, water and sustainable practices. So we decided to align fields and work together. In this collaboration I realized how important mental health was and the role it played in relation to human behaviors and bad habits, in terms of consumption and active -but unconscious- participation in the established systems. And we learned that we didnt want to talk about sustainability, but regeneration. As sustainability aims to maintain what already exists for use by future generations, while regenerative design goes a step further and actually seeks to leave ecosystems better than we found them. We call to action! We decided to take advantage of the connection we have with some Nest City Lab (Apoc-Apoc) members to conduct a session (intervention) to exchange opinions and ideas about behaviors we have in our daily lives. This helped us to learn about the natural habits they have to achieve a state of wellbeing, learning about new activities from others in relation to nature and mental health. The intervention was really interesting, the outcomes were important for us to continue our learning journey and prepare the next intervention for the \u201cDesign Dialogues\u201d. Among the results obtained, one of the most interesting points was to understand the privileged situation we have and to be able to think about regeneration, connection with nature and wellbeing. We both come from Latin American countries, where the predominant issues are poverty, inequality and its consequences, where people have no time, education or money to think about regenerative behaviors and resilience is every day a bit far away. It is hard and disappointing to say but it is the reality of many countries and humans in the world. Therefore, from our shoes we feel that we can contribute our seed to begin to turn this situation around and believe in a resilient future by improving access to regenerative education. For the Design Dialogues, we decided to create another stage of intervention. We detected 20 determinants that for us were the most important for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior. These were divided into 4 different groups: Spiritual, Context/System, Privilege and Mental health. So we created a board with a big circle with all the determinants and people should connect with color thread the ones they think are the most important for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior. The objective of this intervention was to understand people\u2019s thoughts towards regenerative behavior and learn other important determinants that we were not contemplating. The physical result was a catching visual map with 4 different color threads that people used for showing their selection. The cognitive outcomes were even better, the debates and dialogues generated with each participant made me open my mind with some factors I were not realizing. The most selected determinants were: Collectivism, Connection with nature, Time, Awareness/Presence, Regenerative Education and mindful consumerism.

Technology that addresses social and economic vulnerabilities, which aims to reduce the digital divide. Within this area, I show projects in which I have participated as coordinator and designer, participating with real users who are affected daily by these problems, in some achieving concepts and prototypes and in others achieving impact solutions in the public sector. I chose to accompany this card that I found valuable: Economies of care. I also highlighted the long-termism card as important, because it seems to me a key issue to consider in order to continue on this path as a change-maker for emerging futures. In it I emphasize programs based on multi-scale objectives and accompany it with the card of self-sufficiency, as an important element to achieve long-term solutions.

I chose to accompany this card that I found valuable: Economies of care. I also highlighted the long-termism card as important, because it seems to me a key issue to consider in order to continue on this path as a change-maker for emerging futures. In it I emphasize programs based on multi-scale objectives and accompany it with the card of self-sufficiency, as an important element to achieve long-term solutions. Finally, another area of interest is the mobility of people, understanding this as the means of transportation used and how they seriously impact the planet. That is why I chose the card of: Conscious Mobility, which in turn is related to technology and society.

It is important to understand that as human beings we must unlearn and re-learn and re-understand many things. And it is also important to understand that as designers we should not invent anything new, but take advantage of what has been created to improve it and connect what has been invented to design new patterns of behavior and consumption for a regenerative future.

I learned to unlearn so many things, I started to understand who I am and who I want to be. I learned to connect my personal and professional life. My journey started questioning myself about human behavior in life, its relation with nature and other living species. I started the master without any specific idea or issue to \u201csolve\u201d. I was fully motivated to flow in the process and learn new paradigms and perspectives, trying to start a new chapter in life.

After some weeks I realized that \u201ccollaboration\u201d in relation to my master project was a way, a tool to achieve my objectives within my areas of interest. My areas of interest were from the beginning so related to food and water. But also I had a certain interest in new technologies, social innovation, transportation/mobility and economies of care. My first actions were some workshops at Nest City Lab, I assisted to \u201cclimate fresk\u201d and \u201czero waste food\u201d workshops. After that my first intervention came together with some colleagues; we explored our weekly waste and then cooked dinner with some of it. Accompanied by the seminar \u201cliving with your own ideas\u201d, I began to look more closely at my daily food consumption, analyzing how much waste I was generating and decided to start being more conscious and to change my consumption habits little by little. I started to deeply explore convenience and human habits, because I wanted to understand why humans behave in such a destructive way, affecting relations especially with nature and other living beings. Along this path I began to understand many things thanks to various resources that were soaking me with knowledge (books, talks, workshops). This led me to start thinking in regenerative design, and find what is needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior. I started collaborating with Antonio to understand how mental health affected this and how we can work together to find some answers for promoting access to the vast majority of people living in the world who do not have the privilege to engage in regenerative behaviors and transform their habits to improve their mental health and connection with nature. We did an intervention dialogue at Nest City Lab to talk about this issues and learn from others perspectives and then created an interactive board for the \u201cDesign Dialogues I\u201d at IAAC, to make people participate by selecting the most important \u201cdeterminants needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior\u201d and create a dialogue in relation to regenerative design.
