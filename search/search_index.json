Since university, I\u2019ve been designing products and services that sought to solve various problems. At IUAV Venice, I learned some physical computing, using arduino to design in the field of social robotics. I worked as an Innovation Advisor/Project coordinator at the Innovation Laboratory of the Municipality of C\u00f3rdoba, Argentina (CorLab). I was focused in coordinating social innovation and digital divide projects. From design, I experimented new ways to generate public value, enhance the relationship with citizens, and provide new channels and collaboration from agile work methodologies. I consider myself a proactive person, with good learning and leadership skills. Also, I have very good predisposition for teamwork and I\u2019m used to interdisciplinary work, discovering new opportunities and innovative solutions with team colleagues. I believe collaborative work and systemic thinking are essential paths for solving big worldwide problems. As a designer for Emergent Futures, I want to be a change-leader, understand new paradigms, experiment and critically intervene the real world.

My poster represents collaborative innovation, I have a potential interest in connecting changemakers in order to achieve bigger impacts towards the construction of resilient places. I believe collaboration is the most important thing in order to achieve real and big impact solutions.

This for years has been affecting the natural cycles of the planet and all its resources. And personally it makes me very uncomfortable to understand these effects but continue to exercise bad habits blaming the system. Some bad habits of human beings can be seen through the images surrounding these two cards. Next to what for me is the most important card in the space: CO-CREATION, I mention a quote I really liked from a book: - \u201cTo achieve change it is necessary to unlock people\u2019s imaginations and apply it to all areas of life at a microscale.

All my design space is based on my struggle and my interests, told through my experiences. Throughout the space I try to capture my concerns along with experiences of projects, programs and products in which I have participated in my life\u2026 (or at least the ones that marked me the most). From collaborative innovation, I can detect food as the main focus of interest, deploying in it issues such as food security and sovereignty, food education and water literacy and its uses. Awareness brings together all the edges of this sector, where environmental sensitivity, nature and circular production and consumption models (circular economy) are also linked. Another area of interest is design for social innovation, its link with advanced technology, robotics and above all the creation of products and services from conscious technology. Technology that addresses social and economic vulnerabilities, which aims to reduce the digital divide. Within this area, I show projects in which I have participated as coordinator and designer, participating with real users who are affected daily by these problems, in some achieving concepts and prototypes and in others achieving impact solutions in the public sector. I chose to accompany this card that I found valuable: Economies of care. I also highlighted the long-termism card as important, because it seems to me a key issue to consider in order to continue on this path as a change-maker for emerging futures. In it I emphasize programs based on multi-scale objectives and accompany it with the card of self-sufficiency, as an important element to achieve long-term solutions. Finally, another area of interest is the mobility of people, understanding this as the means of transportation used and how they seriously impact the planet. That is why I chose the card of: Conscious Mobility, which in turn is related to technology and society.
