# Digital Prototyping for Design

Here I will be showing some notes, outcomes and reflections of the process of the seminar!

The first class was a general reminder on arduino system, parallel systems and general terms of electronic prototyping. I feel motivated about this seminar, i like playing and learning electronics! We played on making some buzzers melodies to sound with some open-source codes!

In the second class, we reviewed 2d and 3d softwares and made a MIRO board with all the softwares we know how to use. Then we learned about colors, pixels and vectors, PPI/DPI (72PPI normal for monitors and the internet) and image formats (GIF,JPEG,PNG).

Also learned about (TOPoPT) Topology optimization / generative design, mathematical method that optimizes material layout within a given design space. Generative design is not about designing, its about designing the system, we start from nothing, not the other way around.

For the class challenge, I imagined a filtering water system for domestic use, draw a quick sketch and made a 3d model in Rhino, rendered in Vred and finished in Photoshop. Here some images of the process.

The 3rd class, we understood how bidimensional fabrication works and its types. We went through laser systems, laser source and focus. Learned specially the lasercut, its functions, how it works and results of it. Also we understood materials that should and not be used in laser cutting.
Best for cutting: cardboard, plywood, mdf, acrylic /polypropylene


More about arduino and the task of turning on a led with a push button and understand the morse code (dash-dots) by recepting with a light sensor.

**MICROCHALLENGE 1**

Welcome to our WATER REPO! Here we will be updating our work for the MicrochallengeÂ´s... to do: add electronics steps and schematics add picture of final product under 'the system' add code and lasercut files to repo proof-read / final touches add this as README.md to the repo This repository documents a water testing tube designed and built by Josephine, Ramiro, Cagsun, and Korbi during the first MDEF 22/23 microchallenge.</p></blockquote>

Some 3d printing tasks...

I wanted to print a volcano ashtray as an example for testing the printer and parameters in order to know how it works better for future printings. Here I can show some of the process, the 3d design modelling, print and scanning.

Some playing with leds controlling them online!
