# Digital Prototyping for Design

Here I will be showing some notes, outcomes and reflections of the process of the seminar!

The first class was a general reminder on arduino system, parallel systems and general terms of electronic prototyping. I feel motivated about this seminar, i like playing and learning electronics! We played on making some buzzers melodies to sound with some open-source codes!
