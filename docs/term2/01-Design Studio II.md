# Design Journey

**Regenerative Design**

The First MDEF Term was the start point of an exploration and transformation process. I learn to unlearn so many things, I started to understand who I am and who I want to be. I learned to connect my personal and professional life. My journey started questioning myself about human behavior in life, its relation with nature and other living species. I started the master without an specific idea or issue to "solve". I was fully motivated to flow in the process and learn new paradigms and perspectives, trying to start a new chapter in life. 

My initial "fight" was collaborative innovation, I believe collective work is essential for living and creating the future world we want. After some weeks I realized that "collaboration" in relation with my master project was a way, a tool to achieve my objectives within my areas of interest.

My areas of interests were from the beginning so related to food and water. But also I had certain interest in new technologies, social innovation, transportation/mobility and economies of care.
My first actions were some workshops at Nest City Lab, I assisted to a climate fresk and a zero waste food workshop. After that my first intervention came together with some colleagues; we explored our weekly waste and then cooked dinner with some of it.
Accompanied by the seminar "living with your own ideas", I began to look more closely at my daily food consumption, analyzing how much waste I was generating and decided to start being more conscious and to change my consumption habits little by little.

I started to explore deeply convenience and human habits, because I wanted to understand why humans behave in such a destructive way, affecting relations especially with nature and other living beings. Along this path I began to understand many things thanks to various resources that were soaking me with knowledge (books, talks, workshops). This led me to start thinking in regenerative design, and find what is needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior. I started collaborating with Antonio to understand how mental health affected this and how we can work together to find some answers for promoting access to the vast majority of people living in the world who do not have the privilege to engage in regenerative behaviors and transform their habits to improve their mental health and connection with nature. We did an intervention dialogue at Nest City Lab to talk about this issues and learn from others perspectives and then created an interactive board for the "Design Dialogues I" at IAAC, to make people participate by selecting the most important "determinants needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior" and create a dialogue in relation to regenerative design.

As I go through the learning process, I realized that before being a change maker, it is very important to understand that change is first in oneself. We must be conscious and start transformation in our lives. So i started this process some months ago by being more critic while buying food (its origin, processes, packaging, etc) and waste generated, water consumption and waste and goods consumption in general terms. Actually iÂ´m building my urban garden at home together with a worm composting.

So far this is my journey, I am very excited about what is to come. This second term I want to continue working and exploring in relation to regenerative design, and I also want to take the opportunity to work together with other colleagues on projects related to water, and combine them with other interests (technological, culinary, etc).
