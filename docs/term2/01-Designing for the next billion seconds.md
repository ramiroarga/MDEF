# Bootcamp


Reflection

*Let´s be water* was the first thing that I comes to my mind when reflecting on this seminar. I found Andres to be an incredible tutor to start the year thinking about the future of humanity and nature, understanding our behaviors and our relationship with technology.

In my opinion it was one of the best seminars, because of the teaching methods and the topics covered. It was also directly related to the topics I have been exploring, among others, collaboration, system changes and economies of reciprocity and generosity. As a reflection from it, these were my 3 takeaways:

- We can not change the world, this is a response of generations, we can only start the change (transformation). We should talk about transformation, not change.

- “We prefer seeing ourselves living than living”, how can we take distance from that or take advantage for better living? Is there any way of changing the perspective and enhance consciousness to humans in this? Because its something we are already in, i see it impossible to go backwards in digitalization/technology.

- Move slow and target systemic changes.
