Reflexion essay from the seminar

To begin with, the lack of education in humans about resources and their value has led to damaging effects on the environment. This is due in part to the idea of limitless resources in the planet, which encourages over-extraction and abuse of resources without considering the consequences. This ignorance has resulted in the destruction of ecosystems and habitats, leading to a disruption of the balance of nature. It is therefore essential that people are educated on the importance of sustainable resource extraction and use, so that they can make informed decisions about how to conserve resources and reduce their environmental impact.
According to Jason W. Moore, author of “Capitalism in the Web of Life: Ecology and the Accumulation of Capital”, “Design is a crucial tool for changing the game and reconfiguring the systems of extraction. By using design to promote sustainability and create more equitable systems of extraction, we can ensure that all people benefit from the resources of the planet, while also minimizing their environmental impact.” He further argues that “it is essential that we develop new systems of extraction that are more efficient and sustainable, so that we can protect the environment and preserve natural resources for future generations.”
Another interesting article that I read and relates to this idea of changing the game and redesigning convenience is the NY Times article "Tyranny of convenience". It discusses the environmental impacts of consumerism and the need for sustainable change. It argues that current extraction systems have led to a depletion of resources and an over-reliance on convenience, which has had a damaging effect on the environment. This relates to the idea that we need to design more efficient and sustainable systems of extraction, and educate people on the importance of sustainable resource extraction and use. By doing this, we can help reduce the environmental impacts of extraction and ensure that resources are used responsibly and sustainably.
We can build a regenerative future from regenerative behavior and design by encouraging sustainable resource extraction and use and educating people on the importance of preserving resources for future generations. We should also design more efficient and sustainable systems of extraction, so that resources can be used responsibly and sustainably. Additionally, we should create incentives for people to adopt regenerative behaviors and designs, such as financial rewards and public recognition. By doing this, we can create a brighter future for our planet and its inhabitants.

From my experience, I think that all the humans must have the opportunity of transforming their life in a regenerative way, I know we all have different opportunities and lives but those who can and have the chance, should go for it and that is the way of transforming and creating a better future. In my case, the first MDEF Term was the start point of an exploration and transformation process. I learned to unlearn so many things, I started to understand who I am and who I want to be. I learned to connect my personal and professional life. My journey started questioning myself about human behavior in life, its relation with nature and other living species. I started the master without any specific idea or issue to “solve”. I was fully motivated to flow in the process and learn new paradigms and perspectives, trying to start a new chapter in life. I began to look more closely at my daily food consumption, analyzing how much waste I was generating and decided to start being more conscious and to change my consumption habits little by little. I started to deeply explore convenience and human habits, because I wanted to understand why humans behave in such a destructive way, affecting relations especially with nature and other living beings. Along this path I began to understand many things thanks to various resources that were soaking me with knowledge (books, talks, workshops). This led me to start thinking in regenerative design, and find what is needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior. I started collaborating with Antonio to understand how mental health affected this and how we can work together to find some answers for promoting access to the vast majority of people living in the world who do not have the privilege to engage in regenerative behaviors and transform their habits to improve their mental health and connection with nature. We did an intervention dialogue at Nest City Lab to talk about this issues and learn from others perspectives and then created an interactive board for the “Design Dialogues I” at IAAC, to make people participate by selecting the most important “determinants needed for humanity to engage with regenerative behavior” and create a dialogue in relation to regenerative design.

Using the power of today's tools, we can design worlds that are more sustainable and equitable. Through regenerative design, we can create systems that are more efficient and utilize resources responsibly, while also preserving natural resources for future generations. For example, we can use modern technologies to develop renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and geothermal, which can reduce our reliance on finite resources like fossil fuels. As noted by Gregory Bateson, “The major problems in the world are the result of the difference between how nature works and the way people think” (Bateson, 1972). We can use these tools to develop solutions to the environmental problems caused by current extraction methods, such as reducing waste, conserving energy, and preserving natural resources. As author Jason W. Moore states, “Design is a crucial tool for changing the game and reconfiguring the systems of extraction” (Moore, 2020). We can also create incentives for people to adopt regenerative behaviors and designs, such as financial rewards and public recognition. By doing this, we can create worlds that are more sustainable and equitable for everyone.

The appropriate transition to this future world prioritizing nature and equity through collaboration would involve a shift in values. We need to recognize the importance of sustainability and equity and prioritize these values in our decisions. We also need to foster collaboration between different stakeholders, such as government, businesses, and civil society, to ensure that all voices are heard and respected. Finally, we need to invest in education, so that people are aware of the importance of sustainable resource extraction and use and can make informed decisions about the environment. By taking these steps, we can ensure a brighter and more equitable future for our planet and its inhabitants. In the book “Mutual Aid: The Other Law of the Jungle”, authors Servigne and Chapelle argue that mutual aid is essential for the survival of any species, including humans. They argue that cooperation, collaboration, and mutual support are essential for human survival, and that these practices can create a more equitable and sustainable world. They also argue that humans must learn to work with each other and with nature, as both are essential for our continued existence. By practicing mutual aid and collaborating with nature, we can create a more equitable and sustainable future for all. I believe this is one of the most important things to take in count and respect for the transition to a better future world.
According to Peter Nowak's book, “Sex, Bombs, and Burgers: How War, Pornography, and Fast Food Have Shaped Modern Technology”, we should strive to transform our lives in a way that is more sustainable and equitable. This means developing more efficient and sustainable technologies that reduce environmental impacts and prioritize the wellbeing of society. We should also strive to create a more equitable distribution of resources and ensure that all people have access to the basic necessities of life. Finally, we should work to create incentives for people to adopt sustainable and equitable behaviors and designs, such as financial rewards and public recognition. By doing this, we can create a more sustainable and equitable world for everyone. I know that financial rewards can lead to a desire for money and power, which can lead to inequality. However, I believe that if the financial rewards are used in a responsible and equitable manner, they can help to promote sustainable and equitable practices. I think that to make a proper and effective transition, we should hack the actual system with its "own medicine" (financial methods) and in that way enhance people to change and promote good practices in terms of regeneration of the planet and cooperation and respect with the other living beings of our habitats. To conclude, we should start transforming systems and our world by changing our habits and conveniences by collaboration and regenerative behaviors, united for the same positive purpose.
