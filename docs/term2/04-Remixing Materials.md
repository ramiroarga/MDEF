# Remixing materials

As first exercise for the seminar we should understand our relation and interpretation of different materials.

**Materials interaction**

We learned from some materials and made some tests to know how they behave and the potentiality they have for productive endings. Here you can see our process and the results achieved by interacting with Chufa, Coffee and Mycelium!

Mycelium exploration and playing!

Mycelium is the vegetative part of a fungus, consisting of a network of thread-like structures called hyphae that grow through soil or other substrates. It is often referred to as the "root" of the fungus, although it serves a different purpose than the roots of a plant.
Mycelium plays a crucial role in the ecosystem by decomposing organic matter and cycling nutrients back into the soil. It also forms symbiotic relationships with plants, helping them to absorb water and nutrients from the soil in exchange for carbohydrates produced through photosynthesis.

Mycelium is also becoming increasingly popular as a sustainable building material, as it can be grown into a strong, lightweight material that is both biodegradable and renewable. It has potential applications in industries such as packaging, insulation, and furniture.

There are also many medicinal uses for mycelium, as it contains a variety of compounds that have been found to have antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties. For example, the compound beta-glucan found in certain types of mycelium has been shown to stimulate the immune system and may have potential as a cancer treatment. Overall, mycelium is a fascinating and important part of the natural world with many potential applications in various fields.
