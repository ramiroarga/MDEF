# Critical Transfeminist Design

by Laura Benitez Valero

She talked about what a transfeminist perspective in a design practice means and how it can be applied to experimental practices. We will talk more about Design Justive and how we relate to technologies and through technologies. What happens to presences? And who is accountable for absences? Who do we relegate to a condition of subalternity? How do we deal with epistemic violence?

Laura showed really interesting projects related to biohacking and transhumanism and transfemisism, other related to nature-human transformation on how becoming more plant and less human (transplant project)
The project i liked the most was the one about bio-hacking the human body by putting a chip on the hand and being monitored at all time for saving the identity of the user by this chip.
