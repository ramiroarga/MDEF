Also about web3 and NFTs, having some debates and practical work as creating a virtual wallet -TEMPLE-, we learnt about TEZOS and also created a token image and uploaded to the OBJKT WEB and played buying and selling them between us. Then we created a concept of nft and how an idea could be developed in this path using web3. We thinked an idea with Antonio for bio-sense, showing the potential of the tokenization and the use of these technologies.
