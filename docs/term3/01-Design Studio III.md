# Design Journey

**WATER/HUMAN MUTUALISM**

This trimester I found a new path to materialize my ideas and thoughts. I found my purpose is to enhance consciousness about the relation between nature and cities through water. Promoting collaborative design as a path for regenerating the world. Throughout these months I was very focused on how nature acts in different situations in order to regenerate itself. I began to see this continuously in my life, so I decided to pay more and more attention to it. Since the beginning of the 2nd trimester I started working on some water projects. Water for me is so important, many of my main hobbies and interests are related to it, and is the place where I feel a real connection with nature and can connect with my soul. When I am in the water I feel good, I feel relaxed and I find my best state as a human being. So I focused on the actual relation of water with the cities and our habitats. And I realized that water flows through the city in an almost hidden way, that we have hidden its flow since the construction of the city, using it only as a resource to supply our human needs and then discarding it into the ocean. Even without caring about the state in which we return it to the ecosystem, and how this affects the other species that inhabit it. Adding that we also harm other human beings and fauna that inhabit the surface only for the benefit of a few. So the situation is terrible, and I have the need to act and contribute to change it. Then, I decided to design towards the concept of "cohabitating with water" as a relationship of mutualism, to enhance visibilization and the value of
water in our habitats/lives.
