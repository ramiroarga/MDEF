# Hi! ;)

![me](../images/foto.jpg)



My name is Ramiro, I’m an Industrial Designer, graduated from Universidad Nacional de Córdoba in Argentina,
and finished my career as a product designer at IUAV, University in Venice, Italy. 
Since university, I've been designing products and services that sought to solve various problems. At IUAV Venice, I learned some physical computing, using arduino to design in the field of social robotics. Then I had a great formal experience in the innovation lab of my city, where from the strategic design we created solutions to address local problems around technology and innovation. For example creating proposals to reduce the digital divide, creating innovation competitions for citizens to develop changes in the city and also coordinating a design team in international innovation competitions.

As a designer and citizen of the world, I am constantly mutating and acquiring new knowledge. I have not yet managed to determine a specific path, I am interested in many things, always from an environmental point of view, and from a positive human side. I have many topics of interest, and I hope it will always be so, because I feel that each one contributes a lot to my growth and gives me tools to solve others.
