**The role of prototyping in design**

Some of my experience in Roles of Prototyping:

**Role 1: The prototype as a Experimental Component** 

*Insulator for High Voltage Wiring:* 

I have used this role in order to test specific characteristics of the product the client wanted and for the role it had to accomplish. In this case, it had to adapt to a certain structure and hold a high voltage wire and should have an opening system to remove and insert cables quickly and adjust them efficiently. The prototype was made in 3d printing and was used to achieve these specifications, including the development of the electrical test to measure that no arcing is generated.

*TIP: Robot social para personas mayores (Therapy for isolated people):*

The present project deals with the design of a Social Robot dedicated to the assistance and active insertion in society of elderly people. Through the use of an intelligent device, the elderly person is stimulated to rediscover activities that do not confine them within the walls of their home. With the purpose of converging in the same place with other users who share similar interests and are in the same situation. Achieving socialization among them, providing a new motivation to leave home.

**Role 2: The prototype as a means of inquiry** 

*"Ciudad Digital:"* 

Is a program that seeks to promote and disseminate different spaces of cultural interest in the city by implementing new technologies, promoting innovation through a process of Digital Transformation. It functioned as a means to disseminate the city's cultural spaces to the community and to inquiry the incidence and acceptance of digital technology in society through augmented reality.

**Role 3: The prototype as a Research Archetype** 

*Premium Electric City Car Concept Exterior and Interior Design.* 
A graphic product of a concept research in the field of automotive transportation looking to a short-term future.

**Role 4: The prototype as a Vehicle for inquiry**

*LUDIK:* 

Social Innovation Design Project in Food education for children living under vulnerable socio-economic conditions. In this prototyping case, it was a large process where documentation and continuous analysis was made. The prototype was a reflection of the research and represents the result of the whole process, not taking major importance the final tangible prototype. Also, LUDIK was a program created to investigate and create a database of children under these situations, and a means of generating information for future social interventions.

Although I have had experiences prototyping in the different roles, I think I would like to intervene deeper into role 2 "The prototype as a means of inquiry". But I believe that several roles are needed to intersect and be together for a better understanding and development of the design process you carry on.
I would like to experiment in intersecting roles 1 and 2, in order to achieve the development of a prototype as an instrument of inquiry but from an experimental experience.
