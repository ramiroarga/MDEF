# Tech beyond the myth

These two weeks were dedicated to understanding technology from a different perspective. Seeing the technological objects that surround us as results of obsolete design, created to fail and encourage production and consumption without limits. The course was oriented to understand how different technological objects can be hacked and reused for new futuristic purposes, with the addition of creativity as its special spice.

We created a group called "EAGLE EYES", because we opted for an object that was already obsolete and unused due to internal failures and lack of components necessary for its operation. It was a video call camera that allowed to follow whoever was talking through a system of microphones and gimball technology that allowed its fluid movement.
We began to analyze the object and disassemble it completely, managing to understand its functions and meanings, while we put together a forensic report detailing everything we perceived about it.

Then we started our path of creativity, where we collectively came up with new lives that this object could take through new configurations. It was a very fun and fluid process, where we managed to get out of the box and give rise to possible future scenarios.
We created a "Nature hypnotizing robot", a concept for: Nature touching man-made technology and trying to understand it. 

Please have a look to our presentation for more understanding :)
