Personal day-intervention Reflexion

For my personal day-intervention I decided to register all what I do in 24hs and detailed how much food/liquid I consumed. In order to understand my normal consumption for a day and try to identify some unnecessary consumptions in terms of food, electricity and water, and detect possible bad habits or commodities i usually have but don't recognize. As an intervention I decided to change some food-waste habits, by eating them or giving a useful meaning rather than throwing them to the garbage (cause I dont have compost yet). So by reading and investigating fruit or vegetable peels, I understood that they contain many nutrients and important energy to our body. It's ironic to discard something that has been growing and making a large journey to arrive at our tables. 

I also found this calculators to know a bit more the effects of our food consumption:

By involving myself, I could notice many activities and daily consumption of things I have but I never take care, and I think that starting with myself is the way to design for the world. And being an instrument I could understand many habits we as humanity have because of educational reasons, innocence or other. For example, from my childhood I was taught to eat kiwis with a spoon and discard the peel, and for this day I bought kiwis and the packaging promoted you to eat it in the same way. So I decided to eat it and read about it and found that the peel is so important, “Kiwi skins contain a high concentration of nutrients, especially fiber, folate and vitamin E. Eating the skin of a kiwi can increase its fiber content by 50%, boost folate by 32% and raise vitamin E concentration by 34%, compared to eating the flesh alone”.

While giving a second use to my “food-wastes”, I noticed these activities (such as using a banana peel to clean my plants) require time I wasn't used to, and it helped me to spend dead time usually with my phone or social networks. But I enjoyed doing these activities, because they gave me good energy and the satisfaction of doing something relevant for the world, even if it is something too minimal, it's a way of changing who we are and who we want to be in the future. This changed some points of view and food habits that I started to practice in my daily life. I feel that the other videos are incredible and inspire me new possibilities of collaboration in terms of waste creation and also to understand other human habits and ways of positively changing them for a resilient world.
