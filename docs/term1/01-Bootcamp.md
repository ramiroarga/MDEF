*My Fight*

As a designer and citizen of the world, I am constantly mutating and acquiring new knowledge. I have not yet managed to determine a specific path, as there are many fields where I would like to intervene from sustainable, long term and collective design. I believe that making design interventions in completely different areas is an opportunity of collecting tools and resources for change-making.

My poster represents collaborative innovation, I have a potential interest in connecting changemakers in order to achieve bigger impacts towards the construction of resilient places. I believe collaboration is the most important thing in order to achieve real and big impact solutions.
Other interesting fields where I would be excited to intervene are: food education and food insecurity, people's sustainable ways of mobility/transport, social innovation through robotics and new technologies.

*"To achieve change it is necessary to unlock people's imaginations and apply it to all areas of life at a microscale. Our work is meaningless unless it ignites imaginations and provokes debate: design by mutation is intrinsically collective. Designers produce mutations, some of which will grow, evolve, and develop into tangible artefacts that cause global change -- driven to realization by the energy of the crowd."*
