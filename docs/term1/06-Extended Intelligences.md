# Extended Intelligences

This course brought us closer to new technologies such as Artificial Intelligence, knowing methods to apply it within different projects and research modes. I learned new tools to apply AI in different ways that allow me to analyze and create new ways by means of intelligence further than the human brain.
In the experience workshop we created a group and tried to understand how an actual big social problematic could be thinked by AI process. So we tried to understand how we could rise awareness of "Sexist behavior" by the help of this intelligence. So, we decided to think of a device that recognizes/detects sexist physical behavior and offensive speech to warn the environment of violence and abuse through changing music and light of the environment (club). We use the tools learned to identify through some datasets body motion in dark environments to check if the tech was good enough to be able to detect what we wanted. Unfortunately we realized that we were facing a very big challenge not only from a moral but also from a technical point of view, and we needed much more knowledge to be able to find the answers to what we were looking for.
