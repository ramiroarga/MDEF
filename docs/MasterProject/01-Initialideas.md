After a first trimester of a lot of introspective work, learning and new experiences, I decided to change my course regarding my master's project. Without leaving aside the process I had started, in relation to regenerative behavior and the redesign of human habits & conveniences, I decided to focus more on something that has always been my grounding cable and connects me with the person I want to be: water. I believe water is so important in our lives, that we must give more value to it. By this I mean to understand our consumption, be consciouss of the importance of having clean water at our disposal, and overall dont over waste it and take advantage of it in all its forms. 
Water is not just a resource, it is part of our lives, our body is composed of 70% water, therefore it is necessary to take care of it and keep in mind its importance. I do not want to fall into another speech about the importance of water, but I feel that as a designer I have the opportunity to act through my knowledge and communicate the value of water in our lives and the planet. That is why I began to explore from permaculture natural methods of water filtration, with plants that through their roots generate a network of filtering known as "rhizofiltration". Im so engaged with this new stage of exploration and interested in understanding how greywater, rainwater or other forms of water we waste can be reintroduced to a new system where water is cleaned by natural filtrations to grow life, as plants or make it drinkable or have some useful end. 

So, with some classmates also interested in water we made a first step on this big exploration by starting to build a water quality tester, which might be a first stage of a bigger system. 

Moreover, we built a lipid trap, that it is a second stage of water depuration.

To be continued.. i need to write so many things about my explorations, but still can check my board /"mind"/ at this moment...
